    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>¾ cup lukewarm water</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour, divided</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water that's 110 degrees F (44 degrees C) in a small bowl. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 to 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Combine 1 3/4 cups flour and salt in a large bowl. Pour in yeast mixture; mix well until dough comes together.</li>
        <li>Transfer dough to a floured surface and knead until smooth, about 2 minutes. Add remaining 1/4 cup flour if dough is too sticky.</li>
        <li>Roll dough into a 12-inch circle. Transfer to a greased pizza pan.</li>
    </ol>
